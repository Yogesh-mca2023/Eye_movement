# Eye_movement

**Description:** It appears that your project aims to create a simple interactive animation where a pair of eyes follows the movement of the mouse cursor. 
This type of project is often used for fun and creative purposes, 
and it's a good exercise for learning about event handling in JavaScript and basic CSS animations.

**Future Improvements:** Make the pupils follow the cursor more smoothly.Add support for multiple cursors.
